# EDMD-SquareShoulder Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the EDMD-SquareShoulder simulation code to enhance its robustness, physical accuracy, and modularity.

## 1. Selective Particle Position Updates

Modified the main event loop in `main.c` to only advance the positions of particles directly involved in events rather than all particles. This significantly improves performance for large systems while maintaining physical correctness.

## 2. Enhanced Event Geometry for Shoulders

Implemented position correction in both `handle_shoulder_entry` and `process_shoulder_exit` to ensure particles are at the exact square shoulder distance at event time. This prevents drift and maintains the physical integrity of the square-shoulder potential.

## 3. Robust Cell List Management

Improved cell crossing handlers in `cell_interactions.c` to properly validate particle positions at boundaries and ensure proper wrapping with periodic boundary conditions, preventing cell list inconsistencies.

## 4. Full Event Invalidation for Partner Particles

Created new functions in `particle_interactions.c` to not only invalidate events for particles directly involved in interactions but also their potential interaction partners, ensuring no physically invalid events remain in the queue.

## 5. Impulse-Based Energy Injection

Updated the collision handling in `collisions.c` to use a physically correct impulse-based formulation for energy injection, maintaining conservation laws while allowing for energy manipulation.

## 6. Numerically Stable Quadratic Solver

Implemented a more robust quadratic solver in `event_prediction.c` that avoids catastrophic cancellation and handles corner cases properly, ensuring accurate event time calculations even in challenging numerical situations.

## 7. Shoulder State Tracking

Added comprehensive shoulder state tracking in `particle_interactions.c` to properly manage and track which particles are currently engaged in shoulder interactions, enabling more accurate event prediction and processing.

## 8. Enhanced Validation and Logging

Improved energy auditing in `energy_audit.c` to account for shoulder potential energy, providing more detailed validation and logging of energy conservation and system state.

## 9. Comprehensive Testing

Created a new test in `tests/shoulder_collision_test.c` that specifically validates collision and shoulder events, ensuring the physical correctness of the interaction mechanisms.

## 10. Improved Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation throughout the codebase, particularly in main.c, explaining the system design, physical principles, and implementation details to improve maintainability and understanding.

## Compilation

To compile the simulation with all improvements:

```bash
make clean
make
```

To run the tests:
